# SVG-Logo-Maker

  ## Description
  This project involves using node.js and inquirer to build a command-line application that generates a SVG logo file based on customized user input. The command-line, through the use of inquirer, will ask questions such as "What color should the SVG logo be?", and the user will be able to input any color of their choice. A logo.svg file will be generated after the user answers all the prompted questions.
